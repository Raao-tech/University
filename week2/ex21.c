/* 
 NOTE: This exercise is an adaptation of one of the weekly continuous assessment tests of a previous year.
Create a program that declares:

- Two strings variables to store a 4-character length word.

- A 4-integer one-dimensional array.

The program will ask you to enter a string of four characters and store them in the first string (Note: You can assume that you are always going to type four characters).

Next, it will request another string of four characters and store them in the second string (Note: You can assume that you are always going to type four characters).

Then subtract the characters from each position of both chains and save the differences in the corresponding position of the integer array.

Finally the program will show on the screen the integer array for all 4 positions.

The program has to use macros to define the sizes of the strings and the array.

The messages must be shown as they appear in the following example of execution and in the same order (varying only according to the data entered by the user).

The following is an example of program execution:

Enter a string of four characters: baby

Enter a another string of four characters: nose

The difference between each characters of both string is: -12, -14, -17 and 20
